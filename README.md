# OpenWeatherForecastApp
OpenWeatherForecastApp is a single-page web application built using AJAX to fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API, providing users with a 3-day forecast for a specified location. Users can choose to input a city name, zip code, or geographic coordinates, with radio buttons ensuring only one option is selected at a time. Upon submitting the input, the app retrieves the high temperature, cloud cover, and pressure for the next three days after today, calculating daily maximums for temperature and pressure, and averaging cloud cover percentages. The app provides an engaging way to interact with real-time weather data, demonstrating the power of asynchronous JavaScript, JSON handling, and responsive web design for a modern single-page web application.
